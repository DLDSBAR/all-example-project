## About

This repository shows how the `autonomous-learning-library` can be used to build new reinforcement learning agents.
In particular, it contains a *model predictive* agent that predicts future frames and uses them to guide decision making.

## Installation

First, you'll need the latest version of [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org).
If you wish to view [Tensorboard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard) logs, you'll also need to grab a copy of that (it also comes with `tensorflow`).
Then, you'll need to install the `autonomous-learning-library`:


```
pip install autonomous-learning-library
```
